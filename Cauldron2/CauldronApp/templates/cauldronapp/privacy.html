We respect developers’ privacy and will comply with the exercise of these rights on request from the developers/Data Subjects.</p>

While it is User’s responsibility to provide this information, User and Bitergia will cooperate in good faith to determine the best method to achieve this, in each case, and at the request of User and on its behalf, we will use our best efforts to ensure that this information is provided to the Data Subjects (e.g. through the appropriate FOSS Project communication mechanisms). Given our experience in the matter, we can work with the User, and support them whenever possible, in this information effort.</p>
